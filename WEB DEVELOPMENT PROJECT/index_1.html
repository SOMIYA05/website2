<h1>Web development is the process of creating, maintaining, and building websites and web applications.<br>It involves a variety of tasks, including:</h1>
<h2>Coding: Using programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a website's structure, design, and functionality<br> 
Web design: Determining the design and functionality of a website to enhance the user experience<br> 
Database management: Storing and handling databases to ensure data is managed effectively<br> 
Maintenance and updates: Fixing bugs, updating features, and ensuring security</h2>
<h3>Front-end<br>
Focuses on the user-facing side of a website or application.<br>Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop visual elements and determine how a user will interact with the site.</h3>
<h4>Back-end<br>
Deals with server-side functionality, such as storing databases, processing user input, and ensuring website security. </h4>
<h5>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). <br>Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.</h5>
<h6>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).<br>[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.<br> A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</h6>
<p style="background-color:yellow;color:blue;">Analysis<br>
Debra Howcraft and John Carroll proposed a methodology in which web development process can be divided into sequential steps. They mentioned different aspects of analysis.<hr>

Phase one involves crafting a web strategy and analyzing how a website can effectively achieve its goals. Keil et al's research[18] identifies the primary reasons for software project failures as a lack of top management commitment and misunderstandings of system requirements. To mitigate these risks, Phase One establishes strategic goals and objectives, designing a system to fulfill them. The decision to establish a web presence should ideally align with the organization's corporate information strategy.

The analysis phase can be divided into 3 steps:

Development of a web strategy
Defining objectives
Objective analysis
During this phase, the previously outlined objectives and available resources undergo analysis to determine their feasibility. This analysis is divided into six tasks, as follows:

Technology analysis: Identification of all necessary technological components and tools for constructing, hosting, and supporting the site.
Information analysis: Identification of user-required information, whether static (web page) or dynamic (pulled "live" from a database server).
Skills analysis: Identification of the diverse skill sets necessary to complete the project.
User analysis: Identification of all intended users of the site, a more intricate process due to the varied range of users and technologies they may use.
Cost analysis: Estimation of the development cost for the site or an evaluation of what is achievable within a predefined budget.
Risk analysis: Examination of any major risks associated with site development.
Following this analysis, a more refined set of objectives is documented. Objectives that cannot be presently fulfilled are recorded in a Wish List, constituting part of the Objectives Document. This documentation becomes integral to the iterative process during the subsequent cycle of the methodology.</p>
